Downloaded episode(s) do not transfer with migrations.

### Migrating individual series

1. Tap into the **Series** you would like to migrate.
2. Go to the **Overflow menu** (three dots) and tap **Migrate**.

    > **AnimeHat** will do a global search of all the sources you have installed and enabled.
3. Select the **Source** that you'd like to migrate _to_ by tapping the **Series** thumbnail.
4. Choose which data you want to transfer over (e.g., status, history), and you're done.

### Batch migrating between sources

1. Tap into **Browse** on the bottom navbar.
2. Press the **Migrate** tab at the top next to Extensions.
3. Select the **Source** that you'd like to migrate _from_.
4. Tap the **Series** you'd like to migrate _from_ the **Source**.

    > **AnimeHat** will do a global search for the same title among your other active sources.
5. Select the target **Source** and confirm the migration.
