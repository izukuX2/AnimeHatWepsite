Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't AnimeHat on the Google Play Store?
**AnimeHat** will not be on the **Google Play Store**.
The app provides access to third-party streaming sources which may conflict with [Google Play's policies](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/). To ensure the app remains feature-rich and independent, it is distributed directly via our GitHub releases.

## What is AnimeHat Beta?
**AnimeHat Beta** (or Preview) is where we test the latest features like AI recommendations and UI polish before they reach the stable version. It's great for seeing what's next, but might be less stable than the regular version.

## Can I stream anime?
Yes! **AnimeHat** is primarily designed as a high-performance anime streaming aggregator. It brings together various sources into one premium interface with advanced player controls.

## Can I watch cartoon and movies?
Absolutely. **AnimeHat** indices content across various categories including Anime, Cartoon, and Movies, providing a unified experience for all your animation needs.
